Video Game Sales and Ratings
Video game sales data from VGChartz with corresponding ratings from Metacritic
This data set contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies along with critic and user ratings. It is a combined web scrape from VGChartz and Metacritic along with manually entered year of release values for most games with a missing year of release. The original coding was created by Rush Kirubi and can be found here, but it limited the data to only include a subset of video game platforms. Not all of the listed video games have information on Metacritic, so there data set does have missing values.
